# aboutme

## Software Engineering student
Strongest language is java bacause it's what I'm tested in at school but I'm fluent in swift, python, c# and am familiar with others.

#I have 3 big projects that are not open source at the moment but if you ask me about them I'd love to go over them with you.
#### The first two are mobile apps
- [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/forest-home-adventure-guide/id1202685687?mt=8)
- [Android]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afterrabble.foresthomeadventureguide)

The iOS app was written in swift, and the Android app is written in C# using Xamarin.forms. There is additionally a php backend located on a server that feeds up content from two sources, a database that I wrote aswell as the clients own database.

#### And the third is a research project I'm working on for a BioMed Engineering professor at my university.
- 100% Python
- I can't go into this one too much bit it involves modeling how tissue behaves under stress
